# Description

The Tutorial 2 focuses on "Code Management and Deployment", where we used Github for version control and Heroku for application deployment. Specifically for Tutorial 2, we created a main branch in the Github repo, from which we created branches for each group member. Then we cloned that repo and created a React.js project environment setup using VS Code. Each group member made changes to "App.js" in their respective branches and then merged the changes to the "main" branch. After all the changes being merged we used Heroku for deploying the React.js application.
